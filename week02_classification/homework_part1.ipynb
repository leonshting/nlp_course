( so that outside party is one who saved markets from collapse - not geitner , bernanke , paulson ) this lack of market knowledge by all three , paulson , geitner , and bernanke , is important to understand in understanding depth of market understanding in current proposals to allow us treasury to dictate systemic risk decision , when no one at the us treasury , other than saying those words , has shown any knowledge of markets to be able to determine what that is . / s / harvey keitel , markit bon vivant jr 69.121 . 221.97 iq & markets in the iq discussion in the article it is touted that the bernanke has a higher iq and that qualified him for his job . also it has been mentioned that he is an expert in depression era events . neither worked to have bernanke act appropriately in this global crisis which he / bernanke caused via fighting the spike in oil and gold prices and his efforts directly caused this crisis . so that with bernanke\\'s higher iq did not have him perceive what he was doing would cause a near global market meltdown and his studies of the depression era did not clue him in not to cause nearly a depression . / s too true ioq ix 69.121 . 221.97 demonizing wall street for us government caused crisis in the bubble , all agree was caused by greenspan , and in the huge push to give mortgages to those non qualified which all agree was caused by fannie mae , etc and by congress , this directly lead to the subprime debacle and beginning of the global crisis - none of which was caused by wall street . then in the fight by bernanke to stop the projected inflation caused by oil & gold spikes , his actions massively slammed the overall economy which was perking along just fine even with the subprime debaclev which was a smaller part of the usa $ 15 trillion economy . next , massive jaw boning of the huge crisis was done by paulson to get funds and that caused the coup de grace , the huge retrenchment of all spending by consumers ... all these events were not caused by wall street then paulson , bernanke and later hugely obama and congress , again and again bad mouthed again and again wall street claiming that this whole series of events was caused by wall street when it was mainly caused by the us governement and aided by consumer spending retrenchment but congres and the pundits caused the us population to believe the lie it was wall street\\'s fault due to gambling . all distortion 100 % . destruction of capital formation and wall street one of the key features of bernanke\\'s job in oversight for the usa economy is in also protecting capital formation ... and the engine of economic growth in the usa for 300 years has been the usa efficient capital distribution to new ventures , old ventures , etc and the recent sequence of bad mouthing by all concerned of wall street publicly now and including esp the talking heads on cnn and esp cnbc has severely damaged that core of the reason for usa dominance and leadership for those 300 years . added to that huge destruction is the special refusal by all of the us government to identify and prosecute the huge fraudulent short selling of all major wall street firms and major usa banks which was fraudulent esp as done in a intentional and ever increasing crecend',\n",

       "       '\" unprotected i\\'m going to edit based on my comments in talk : new_anti-semitism #sourcing_claims_for_ . 22country - specific_incidents so could we discuss them now ? all the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new anti-semitism i . e . coming from the left , related to radical anti-zionism etc . ( talk ) they may well be , but they are not sourced that way . i don\\'t think we can expect the words \" \" new anti-semitism \" \" to appear in every single report we reference . we\\'ve defined it , and we\\'ve linked to many sources who are defining it . the definition is : it is a form of judenhass that emanates from the left . it is characterized by the demonization of the world\\'s only jewish state and of jews as an ethnicity and a religion . israel\\'s right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied . the jewish people\\'s right of self-determination is denied . double standards are applied , whereby the actions of the jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her . jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the jewish state . symbols and images associated with classic anti-semitism are used : for example , blood libels are resurrected , the jewish state and jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving jews or zionists or israelis plotting to take over the world , or being in control of other governments , or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others . arab and islamic anti-semitism are excused and ignored . straw-man attacks are made , whereby jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of israel is anti-semitism , and that is then used to condemn jewish groups as unreasonable , and to deny that there is any such thing as the \" \" new anti-semitism . \" \" all of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against jews and their synagogues and schools , particularly in europe . it is found in conjunction with anti-americanism ( because jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the american government ) , anti-zionism , and the anti-globalization movement . all the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components , so when we find them , we can offer them as examples , so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-semitism or attacks on jews . ( talk ) my worry is that livingstone has not been ( at least in the sources provided ) accused of anti-semitism , and that most of the discussion of galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters . add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism ( not reporting others allegations ) , which is or ( and unwise in the case of galloway ) . the nus thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so i\\'d just want to tidy that up . livingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-semitism ( got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it ) , as has galloway , and without question his supporters . the section talks about it in relation to that election . by all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit , and we can talk later if there are any disagreements . ( talk ) slim , whose definition is this ? all the sources put together . the above are the issues they agree on . it was posted weeks ago . ( talk ) i think you mean \" \" all the sources from one side of the argument put together \" \" . it\\'s been a while since we discussed this , so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative ? sorry , you\\'ll have to look in the archives ; they\\'re either there or in the article . by \" \" all the sources , \" \" i mean all the sources who study new anti-semitism . the above are the elements they appear to agree on . ( talk ) i\\'m asking you which sources you consider to be authoritative . please respond . [ [ user : c',\n",

       "       '\" , 24 november 2011 ( utc ) my apology if you find a personal attack in my more recent comment above . i have re-read it and can still find none . you \" \" argue that we should make the definition of polygon consistent with what the lay public is likely to encounter and study \" \" , while i believe that \" \" the elementary logic of physical objects is best used in the introductory lead \" \" . that looks like agreement to me . where we seem to differ is that you regard this as calling for a euclidean mathematical definition , while i do not believe that the lay person has sufficient mathematical appreciation for that to be appropriate to the article lead . as to the actual content , the lead grew historically as a result of several contributors thrashing out our differing approaches . what emerged should not be treated lightly , or substantially edited without prior agreement . i am happy to discuss the rest of your proposal , and no doubt others will chip in to help reach a consensus . i did restore a little of what you wrote , but in the mean time let us not play ping-pong with the page itself . on the matter of references , regular polytopes and convex polytopes are widely-read works which can hardly be described as specialised : they are indeed precisely what this lay person encountered and studied . some others which i referenced are original sources - which , out of respect to you as a professional mathematician , i would not pull away from drawing to your attention . others do move beyond a euclidean treatment , and were there simply to make the point which begins the subsequent paragraph . more directly relevant is the issue that most lay people would regard a pentagram as a \" \" star polygon \" \" , recognised as such since the days of archimedes but excluded by the definition you gave , which is more formally understood as a \" \" simple polygon \" \" . while mathematicians such as grÃ¼nbaum and yourself might choose to frequently omit descriptors such as \" \" simple \" \" or \" \" convex \" \" in treatments of these objects ( grÃ¼nbaum explicitly , yourself implicitly ) , a general introduction to the subject can take no such luxury . the article lead should conform as far as is possible to the lay person\\'s preconceptions , whereby polygons may be divided into those which self-intersect and those which do not . with that proviso , if you have ideas for significant changes to the article lead , i would hope you can share them with us first . â cheers , ( talk ) 20:34 \"',\n",

    "* concatenating several embeddings\n",
